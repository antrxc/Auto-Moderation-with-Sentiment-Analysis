**Imports:**

- `discord`: This library is used to interact with the Discord API, allowing the code to connect to a Discord server and send/receive messages.
- `asyncio`: This library is used for asynchronous programming, which is essential for handling multiple events and tasks concurrently in bots.
- `nltk`: This library provides tools for natural language processing (NLP).
- Uses `Sentiment Analysis` to filter the messages in the chat
- Responds using Discord Events from the `discord api` as triggers to calculate the intensity of the message and decide on consequences 


**Overall Functionality:**

This code creates a Discord bot that monitors messages for negative sentiment and takes actions based on configurable thresholds and roles. It uses sentiment analysis to identify potentially offensive messages and mutes users who repeatedly violate community guidelines. Moderators are notified when users are muted to allow for human intervention if needed.

**Important Notes:**

- This code is a basic example and might need adjustments for specific Discord server needs.
- Consider adding configuration options for the mute role name, mute duration, sentiment threshold, and warning message content.
- You'll need to replace the bot token (a secret key) with your Discord bot's token to run it.
- Be mindful of using automated moderation techniques, as they can sometimes lead to false positives. Human moderation is still important for complex situations.
